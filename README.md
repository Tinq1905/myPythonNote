#Hello!#

Only my personal learning notes(Python) saving  in this place.
I love Python!

## 28th JAN ##
Awful day!
I followed the steps in the book and finished building a sample web page using *flask* , which is a tiny web frame.
Actually, I haven't understood, why is it called *tiny*.
Cause...Sooooo many stuffs to be memorised. I was almost driven insane in those hours.

Ok..stop complaining.
In conclusion, I have basically understanding of what is flask.
Some plug-ins are crucial for flask like *flask-scripts*, *flask-moment*, and *flask-bootstraps*.
By the way, bootstraps is a brilliant tool to build easy pages.
*render_template* is a really important function which is frequently used in routes.
*Extends* (in jinjia2) can be used to ease my life in composing html files. This function helps to avoid typing repeatly contents.

I have to say I need much more knowledges than I have ever imagined, especially considered I nearly know nothing about javascript and html.
This is it today. I will take a break and continuelly learning how to build web form and receive messages from users.
