#Hello!#

Only my personal learning notes(Python) saving  in this place.
I love Python!

## 28th JAN ##
Awful day!
I followed the steps in the book and finished building a sample web page using *flask* , which is a tiny web frame.
Actually, I haven't understood, why is it called *tiny*.
Cause...Sooooo many stuffs to be memorised. I was almost driven insane in those hours.

Ok..stop complaining.
In conclusion, I have basically understanding of what is flask.
Some plug-ins are crucial for flask like *flask-scripts*, *flask-moment*, and *flask-bootstraps*.
By the way, bootstraps is a brilliant tool to build easy pages.
*render_template* is a really important function which is frequently used in routes.
*Extends* (in jinjia2) can be used to ease my life in composing html files. This function helps to avoid typing repeatly contents.

I have to say I need much more knowledges than I have ever imagined, especially considered I nearly know nothing about javascript and html.
This is it today. I will take a break and continuelly learning how to build web form and receive messages from users.


## 29th JAN
I feel soooooo good for achieving an easy page by the knowledges I acquired yesterday, which allow user to sign in!

I did it by observing the examples found in **bootstrap** website. The **href** help to redirect to another page and thanks to the great flask-wtf plug-in, the forms were built nicely.

It's rainy for all day. I love rain, but the fact that I have to spend my whole tomorrow in part-time job depresses me. I'm gonna keep recording my learning footsteps here.

Feel tired now, good night.

## 30th JAN
I'm gonna briefly conclude today. I learnt about `flash` and apply this useful function to a web page. The `flash` can be conviently used to deliver short info to users. I like this function.

However, I don't really understand the justifiction of `redirect`, why we need this function? 

Maybe I'll find out some details tomorrow!

## 31th JAN
Actually, this should be my python note, while I start to find that I love **bootstrap**. I almost spent the whole day playing with different bootstrap styles. They have lots of functions like `modal`, `jumbotron`, `textarea` and `button`. 

The good news is that I am familier with `JS` `CSS` and `HTML`. They are all crucial for web development. But I'm quite sure that I want to be more than a web developer. So I decided to focus on python from tomorrow. According to my book, tomorrow I will go with SQL basic knowledge. I have learnt Oracle SQL before, so that it should be quite easy for me.

## 1th FEB
I had a really tired day...I went shopping with my gf...I bought her a pair of heels.

So..I didn't continue my python learning today. So sad.

However, I successfully install a linux distro on my computer and I'm using CLI to edit this file. If everything goes correctly, I will commit in here and this file will be synced in the website.

This is it. A tired but relax day.

By the way, git is Awesome!!!!!!!! 

It's really a powerful tool to manage and learn codes. Github is just full of treasures for me. I `clone` the repo of the author and I can easily use `checkout` function to see the details of each version. That's more than great!!!!!
I also leart how to use `commit` and `push` to push my local version to github. It's amazing!!!!!
